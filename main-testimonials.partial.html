                    "Thanks to yoga classes at the Atta Yoga studio, 
                    I have become much calmer and more organized in my thoughts and actions. 
                    Yoga is really good option for those who don't like the usual active gym workouts. 
                    I love my yoga classes at Atta!"

                    "I have been practicing at Yoga Atta Studio for two years now. 
                    During this time, I have found many friends and like-minded people here. 
                    I like that this is not just a yoga studio, but a whole community that 
                    promotes a healthy approach to mind, body, and life overall"

                    "Yoga is my path to a healthy and flexible body. I tried different 
                    sports, but they quickly tired me. Yoga helps me to be in good 
                    shape without exhausting phisycal exertion. In addition, I like the 
                    studio itself where classes are held and the coaches â€” very pleasant and polite people."
